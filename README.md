# go-url-shortener
A url shortener based on [Eddy Wm's implementation](https://www.eddywm.com/lets-build-a-url-shortener-in-go/).

Fully tested and deployed in Docker.

This is mostly an experiment in me both learning Go and getting better at Docker. I've never containerized the testing environment before.
